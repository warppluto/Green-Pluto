* Worldcoin: Worldcoin widget was added to front-end, since this may be a game with restrictions in many juristications.
Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain the app_id and thus the widget: <IDKitWidget /> does not show up in frontend althoug necessary code is added

* 1inch: your product fits well as a complement to players to swap their tokens to play the game (place bets), or
for certain cases for Algo providers to compete with the algos and get the best prices.
Tried to add a widget/component in frontend for users to swap, but didn't make it to full integration and removed from the last version (left the button though)
